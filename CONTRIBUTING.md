# Contributing to ChoreOps

Thanks for contributing to ChoreOps.

## Quick start

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make focused changes with tests when applicable
4. Run validation locally
5. Open a pull request

## Local validation requirements

Run these before opening a PR:

- `./utils/quick_lint.sh --fix`
- `mypy custom_components/firewalla_local/`
- `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=line`

If your change only affects a narrow area, you may run a targeted test suite, but include rationale in your PR.

## Code quality expectations

- Follow `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md`
- Follow `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Follow `docs/QUALITY_REFERENCE.md`
- Use constants instead of hardcoded user-facing strings
- Use lazy logging (for example, `LOGGER.debug("value: %s", value)`)
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the problem

## Pull request expectations

- Link the issue when applicable (`Closes #...`)
- Explain what changed and why
- Describe validation performed
- Note documentation impact (README/wiki/docs)
- Call out breaking changes and migration impact when relevant

## Before merging to main

Use a pull request to `main` so automation can close issues and categorize release notes.

- Include a closing keyword in the PR body when applicable (`Closes #...`)
- Apply the correct release-note label for the change type
- Remove excluded triage or status labels before merge
- Use a release-note-friendly PR title
- Complete the PR template sections for validation and release notes

See `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` for the canonical main-merge and release automation contract.
